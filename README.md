# Assessment

## Task 1 [4 hours]
This is a start-template project in Xamarin.Forms. The goal of the first task is to assess your skills in coding practices and code- management practices.


## Changes:
1. Create a new tab in the application

2.  Create two buttons in the new tab that will each invoke an endpoint in our API. The endpoints have anonymous access and do not require authentication. Mentioned endpoints are
 * https://malkarakundostagingpublicapi.azurewebsites.net/success
 * https://malkarakundostagingpublicapi.azurewebsites.net/fail

When response is received – show an alert popup with result (error message for errors, success message for successful calls).

3. Create a button to the new tab in top corner that will open up a form to ask for User’s name & age. When data is submitted, display collected information textually in created tab (above the buttons created before). Only show the User data fields when information has been entered.

#### Your task is to create a fork of the project, prepare the changes and create a pull request. 
#### You should not spend more than 4 hours on the task. If you have time left over in your task, feel free to showcase your skills & include features to the views.



## Task 2 [2 hours]

The Undo stack consists of web services mainly in Azure, Web API, Admin panel & Xamarin.Forms application. Take a look at the home tab of the Undo application, read through the letter from the client and write us a proposed solution and prepare questions that will help you understand the task better in detail and to make better choices when deciding for the solution.

Letter from client: “We want to have a new feature in the application’s home tab – a news section. The news section’s goal will be providing news to users using the application, where we would be posting content weekly or fortnightly.”
